# Preliminaries



## My assumption

You have completed the pre-workshop prep material

https://www.rc.colorado.edu/training/workshop/2016basicsbootcamp

if not, do so now



## Our etherpad

https://etherpad.net/p/hpcboot-bash



## Help

- chat
- stickies
- helpers
- neighbors

![](img/help.jpg)



## Get data {data-background=#990000}

(link on etherpad)

https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhbg6qsjalpm56q/data-shell.zip?dl=0

1. Download .zip file
2. Extract onto Desktop
3. Verify that you have a folder called `data-shell`
4. Green sticky when done



## Let's go back

![](img/terminal.jpg)



## Open a terminal emulator {data-background="img/terminal-dark.jpg"}

**Macintosh**

Cmd+space: terminal

**Windows**

Windows key, then type "Git Bash" and press enter



# Navigation {data-background="img/navigation-dark.jpg"}



## Key commands

List directory contents

`ls`

Change directory

`cd`

Print working directory

`pwd`



## Challenge  {data-background=#990000}

What is your working directory?

What is in your working directory?



## Solution  {data-background=#005b00}

What is your working directory?

`pwd`

What is in your working directory?

`ls`



## Flags

```
ls -a   # show all

ls -l   # long form

ls -h   # human readable

ls -F   # append indicators

ls -R   # recursively list files
```

```
ls -R -a -h -l -F

ls -RahlF
```




## Man pages (`q` to exit)

```
man ls
```

![](img/rtfm.png)



## Challenge  {data-background=#990000}

1. Navigate to the folder `data-shell/` 

2. List **a**ll of the files in that folder



## Solution  {data-background=#005b00}

```
cd Desktop/data-shell

ls -a
```



## Listing contents of directory

```
ls creatures
```




## Challenge  {data-background=#990000}

1. List the contents of `data-shell/data/pdb/` **without changing your current working directory**



## Solution  {data-background=#005b00}

```
ls data/pdb
```





## Where is home? {data-background=#990000}

Use `cd` $\sim$ to navigate home. 

1. What is the path to your home directory?

2. Is your home path the same as your neighbor's?



## The root directory

![](img/filesystem.svg)



## What's in your root directory?  {data-background=#990000}

**Challenge:**

List the contents of your root directory *without navigating to it*

i.e., do not use `cd`



## Solution {data-background=#005b00}

`ls /`



## Relative vs. absolute paths

Relative:

```
cd Desktop

cd ../Documents
```

Absolute:

```
cd /Users/max/Desktop
```



## Challenge: using absolute vs. relative paths


## Challenge: predicting output {data-background=#990000}

`pwd` displays `/Users/thing/`

What will `ls ../backup` display?

![](img/filesystem-challenge.svg)



## Going up in the file tree

`..` always* refers to one level up in the directory tree 

![](img/filesystem-challenge.svg)



# Files and directories {data-background="img/files-dark.jpg"}



## Key commands

`nano`

`rm`

`mkdir`

`mv`

`cp`



## File operations {data-background=#990000}

1. Use `nano` to edit data-shell/writing/haiku.txt
    
2. Put `haiku.txt` in `data-shell/writing/old/`

**Bonus**: Open a file with nano in read-only mode



## Wildcards

In `data-shell/molecules/`

```
ls *.pdb

ls p*

ls *than*
```

Single character equivalent is `?` 

```
ls ?thane.pdb
```



## Using wildcards {data-background=#990000}

When run in the molecules directory, which ls command will produce this output?

ethane.pdb methane.pdb

1. `ls *t*ane.pdb`
2. `ls *t?ne.*`
3. `ls *t??ne.pdb`
4. `ls ethane.*`

**Bonus**

Put all files with "thane" in the filename in a new directory called `thanes/`



## Counting words, lines, and characters

In `data-shell/molecules/`

Count the number of lines in each .pdb file

```
wc *.pdb
```



## Redirecting output

```
wc *.pdb > counts.txt
```


## Piping 

```
wc *.pdb | sort
```

Output from command 1 $\rightarrow$ input for command 2



## Challenge {data-background=#990000}

Create a file `data-shell/data/pdb/line-counts.txt` that: 

- contains line counts for each .pdb file in `data-shell/data/pdb` with a molecule name ending in "ol"
- is sorted from smallest to largest line count

**Hint: use wildcards, piping, and output redirection**



## Solution {data-background=#005b00}

Create a file `data-shell/data/pdb/line-counts.txt` that: 

- contains line counts for each .pdb file in `data-shell/data/pdb` with a molecule name ending in "ol"
- is sorted from smallest to largest line count

```
cd data/pdb

wc -c *ol.pdb | sort > line-counts.txt
```
